## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned
I learned how to add custom styles (fonts and colors) using the new **@theme** directive in Tailwind CSS (Information only for Tailwind v4+).
```css
@theme {
    --color-fm-green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --color-fm-grey-700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --color-fm-grey-800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --color-fm-grey-900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    --color-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

    --font-inter: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

and a little about custom pseudo-selectors

```css
@custom-variant hocus (&:hover, &:focus);
```
### Continued development

I'd like to focus on learning tailwind further, and once I'm comfortable with it, move on to tailwind + react interoperability.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind site](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Have amazing docs <3
- [Tailwind cheat sheet](https://tailwindcss.504b.cc/?ref=dailydev) - A very quick and easy-to-use cheat sheet for Tailwind v4.
